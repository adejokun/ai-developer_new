# Part 4: Optimizing schedules, allocations and plans through multiple programming models with Nerav Doshi

Learn to use tools to develop DO models - There are plenty of tools on the market to develop and solve optimization models, including some open source ones.
IBM offers two ways to start learning DO at no cost: **Decision Optimization for Watson Studio (DO for WS)** and **CPLEX Optimization Studio (COS)**.

## CPLEX Optimization Studio
CPLEX Optimization Studio (COS) can be very easily downloaded and installed on your laptop.

### Download
There is an unlimited free edition for academics as part of the Academic Initiative, and there is a free limited edition for everyone (MP problems limited to 1000 variables and 1000 constraints).
[CPLEX Optimization Studio developer edition or free community edition.](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/pricing)
